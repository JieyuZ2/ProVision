## What's ProVision?

ProVision is an extendable data generation engine that produces instruction data for large multimodal language models (MLMs). 

In particular, it synthesizes instruction data via data generators (Python programs) and scene graphs rather than proprietary models.
It also includes a scene graph generation pipeline consisting of various state-of-the-art models (e.g., object detection model). 
Thus, one can generate instruction data for any given image by first generating the scene graph and then applying data generators.

Provision supports the generation of both single-image and multi-image instruction data.
One can also extend the engine by adding new data generators.

## Usage

For augmented scene graph generation, please follow the instructions in [SCENE_GRAPH_GENERATION.md](SCENE_GRAPH_GENERATION.md).

For instruction generation, please refer to the demo notebook in the `notebook` folder.
It contains a step-by-step guide on 
1. how to generate single-image instruction data for images using ProVision's data generation engine
2. how to generate multi-image instruction data for images using ProVision's data generation engine

## ProVision-10M dataset

We release the ProVision-10M dataset, a 10M synthesized instruction data at this [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/ProVision-10M)
